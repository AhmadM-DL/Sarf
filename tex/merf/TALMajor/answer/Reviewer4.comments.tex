enhanced for Arabic text by enabling morphology-based matching.

\item \label{Review.4.1} 
Clarity:   
It is not clear how to associate code actions with 
subexpressions!

\answer{
  We elaborate the use of code actions in Section~\ref{sec:numnorm} 
    by introducing Figure~\ref{fig:nunnormalgo} and discussing it 
    in the Section. 
}

\item \label{Review.4.1} 
Correctness :  
- $Syn^k$ introduces a lot of noise especially if $k$ is large. 

\answer{
  7 is a limit... 
}
\itodo{
  Use the same answer for Reviewer 3, and say why you used 7. 
}


\item \label{Review.4.1} 
In the results section, there is no standard evaluation. 
The evaluation is based on comparisons with non-standard 
task-specific tools. 
Also, the reported precision and recall are very sensitive 
to the quality of the annotator!

\answer{
  Same answer to reviewer 3 results... 
}

\itodo{
Say something about clarifying the evaluation process. 
}



\end{enumerate}
