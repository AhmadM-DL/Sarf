The rich nature of Arabic morphology makes morphological analysis key for Arabic natural language processing applications.  Arabic morphological analyzers return several morphological solutions for a given Arabic word.  Each solution consists of several morphological features such as part of speech and gloss description tags.  Often times, applications need only few of those features.  This paper presents Sarf, an application customizable morphological analyzer for Arabic.  Sarf provides an interface that allows application developers to (1) control and prioritize the analysis, (2) refine solution features, and (3) define categories and associate them with existing morphemes. 

Sarf uses agglutinative and fusional morphemes for affix representation, and extends and refines the morpheme lexicons of SAMA and BAMA.  This reduces redundant morphemes, and subsequently inconsistent morpheme tags in the lexicons.  It also solves the segmentation correspondence problem between an input word and the several parts of the associated morphological solution.  It uses diacritics to refine solutions, and solves the `run-on words' problem.  The implementation of Sarf  efficiently encodes the morpheme lexicons.  Sarf was used in several NLP applications for information extraction and provided more accurate solutions than existing solvers with faster running time.
